/**
 * RxJava provides some high level concepts for concurrent execution, like ExecutorService we're not dealing
 * with the low level constructs like creating the Threads ourselves. Instead we're using a {@see rx.Scheduler} which create
 * Workers who are responsible for scheduling and running code. By default RxJava will not introduce concurrency
 * and will run the operations on the subscription thread.
 *
 * There are two methods through which we can introduce Schedulers into our chain of operations:
 * - <b>subscribeOn allows to specify which Scheduler invokes the code contained in the lambda code for Observable.create()
 * - <b>observeOn</b> allows control to which Scheduler executes the code in the downstream operators
 *
 * RxJava provides some general use Schedulers already implemented:
 *  - Schedulers.computation() - to be used for CPU intensive tasks. A threadpool
 *  - Schedulers.io() - to be used for IO bound tasks
 *  - Schedulers.from(Executor) - custom ExecutorService
 *  - Schedulers.newThread() - always creates a new thread when a worker is needed. Since it's not thread pooled
 *  and always creates a new thread instead of reusing one, this scheduler is not very useful
 *
 * Although we said by default RxJava doesn't introduce concurrency, some operators that involve waiting like 'delay',
 * 'interval' need to run on a Scheduler, otherwise they would just block the subscribing thread.
 * By default **Schedulers.computation()** is used, but the Scheduler can be passed as a parameter.
